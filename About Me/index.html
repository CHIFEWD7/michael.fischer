	<p>What is a Hyper Fisch?</p>

	<p>My "real name" is Michael Fischer. As a person I am most easily explained by the bulleted factoids above. Hyper Fisch is this way-cool pseudonym I gave myself in an attempt at explaing those bullets within a singular word. Any real human would probably wonder why some basic graphic designer needs a fake name. The excuse I give myself is that when I am not in the office slinging the sexiest of graphics or in the studio directing top-notch photo shoots, I can be found running around the streets of Chicago snapping photos in places I probably shouldn't be. It is my way of creating street art in way that's original to me, with my camera. AKA making momma proud everyday.</p>

	<p>Currently my big project is what I am calling "The Chicago Project." For more details on this project or work enquiries feel free to reach out to me via email at hyperfish@gmail.com.</p>
